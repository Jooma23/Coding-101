<!-- Today's practice: 

- Index: Name of the thing we're voting for, nothing else: done
- Details: Any user comes in, casts their vote on this or that:
    > Store the name in localStorage upon loading the page (this should only happen once per domain)
    > Add fieldsets with only 2 radio buttons and a hidden <div> to display results
    > Upon voting: 
        > the vote is stored to firestore   
        > the div underneath is unhidden, and the data from firestore is displayed
        > upon changing vote, it's re-calculated
- Polish: change link url to short one. add the this is for fun as a query param
