        <h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
        <p>The Company does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to third parties.</p>
        <p>The Company may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (email, name, address, phone number) is not transferred to the third party. The Company may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to the Company, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
        <p>The Company may disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the Company or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company; and/or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Company, or the public.</p>

        <h3>Tracking User Behavior</h3>
        <p>The Company may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within the Company, in order to determine what the Company services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content, prioritize important features, and market within the Company to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>

        <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>The Company may automatically collect information about your computer hardware and software. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding the use of the Company's website.</p>
        
        <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>The Company's website or application may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the Company's pages, or register with Company's site or services, a cookie helps the Company to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Company's features that you customized.</p>
        <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Company's services or websites you visit.</p>

        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>This website or app may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

        <h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>The Company secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Company uses the following methods for this purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TLS Protocol</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>
        <p>We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet that are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed.</p>

            <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, provided we have obtained your informed consent;</li>
            <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us;</li>
            <li>Comply with an existing legal obligation; or</li>
